# lunch simulation
## elle lilin kyuss lim-fauteux

This is a lunch break simulation where you serve lunch based on different options. It is based on the trending videos of office lunches from korea, as all the dishes (as well as the variable names) are korean food. Korean cuisine usually has a bunch of banchan which are side dishes meant to eat with your main meal, and the project showcases that with many options. 

The images are drawn by myself.
